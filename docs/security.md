# Security Policy

If you discover a vulnerability within one of our applications, please do NOT create a GitHub issue or use any public platform to report it. Instead, either:

- Create a private ticket on our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com)
- Notify us via email at `support@nhcarrigan.com`

We do not offer any rewards (commonly known as "bug bounties") for reporting security issues.
