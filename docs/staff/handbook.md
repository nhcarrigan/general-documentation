# Staff Handbook

We rely on our staff members in any position to help keep our community running smoothly.

These are some general requirements for our staff team. Check the links in the sidebar for information specific to your position.

## Activity Requirements

We do not require specific levels of activity from our staff. We understand that you are volunteering your time to help our community, and it is highly appreciated.

That being said, if you anticipate being inactive for more than a week, we do ask that you let us know in the Discord `#staff-chat` so we are aware that you will not be around to address issues. If you are inactive for more than a month with no communication, we will remove you from the staff team - however, you will always be welcome to return when your schedule allows!

## Holopin Badge

Staff members are eligible for a special staff badge on [Holopin](https://holopin.io/@naomis-novas). If you would like this badge, reach out to Naomi on Discord to claim it!

## Moderator Guidelines

Being a moderator does not mean that you are above our community, and we ask that you do not behave as such. It simply means that you are trusted with additional tools to help ensure our community is safe.

### General Expectations

Our moderators are meant to be the example of ideal community members. As such, you should be active within our community, adherent to our rules, and welcoming to our members.

However, you are also still a member of the community yourself. Not every interaction needs to be a moderation action. Socialise with your fellow community members and remember that we are here to have fun!

We have many community platforms, some of which you may not be familiar with. That's okay! While you are trusted to maintain all of our platforms, you only need to moderate the ones you're comfortable with. If you have any questions, you can always reach out to your fellow moderators.

### Discord

Moderating Discord primarily involves ensuring our members are interacting with each other in accordance with our rules. If a member is not acting appropriately, you should take action relative to their infraction.

#### Warning a Member

For actions that are mostly harmless, such as mild spam, or an insult that isn't discriminatory (i.e. "You're a jerk"), you can issue a warning. Use Becca to give a warning to the member so the action is appropriately logged.

```txt
/mod warn @user this is the reason
```

#### Kicking a Member

If a member is arguing with you directly, spamming a channel, or breaking our rules in a non-excessive manner, often times a kick is sufficient to show them that you are serious about enforcing our standards. Use Becca to kick the member so the action is logged.

```txt
/mod kick @user this is the reason
```

#### Banning a Member

Careful consideration must happen before banning a member. Discord bans are IP specific and the member will not be able to rejoin until the ban is lifted. When you need to ban someone, use Becca to do so.

```txt
/mod ban @user 7 this is the reason
```

Becca will ask you to confirm that you intend to do this.

### Working With Fellow Mods

On GitHub, our community organisation has a `moderators` team. Within this team, you can create private discussions that only your fellow moderators will see. On Discord, we have a private staff-chat channel for the same purpose.

These are places where you can bring up concerns, ask fellow moderators how they would approach a situation, or request assistance in dealing with an issue. We will gladly help you resolve the problems at hand.

Remember that we are a team. We do not want to disagree with each other publicly. If you have concerns about a moderation action, or about a fellow moderator's actions, discuss them in one of these private areas. If you cannot reach a resolution, reach out to Naomi for guidance.

### Logging Actions

Moderation actions on Discord are automatically logged. However, moderation actions on other platforms should be manually logged to the `#council-activity` channel in our Discord community.

## Mentee Guide

Naomi will occasionally select passionate developers who have struggled to break into the field, and take them under her wing to mentor them.

As a member of the Naomi's mentorship programme, you may be assigned issues and tasks that are essential to the maintenance of and improvement on our projects. We greatly appreciate your dedication to our work, and we have the highest respect for you volunteering your time. Tasks that are assigned, however, will need to be completed in a timely manner.

If you find that you are unable to complete a task quickly, that's okay! We ask that you communicate with the rest of the mentees in our chat so someone can assist you in getting the issue resolved. Our number one goal is to ensure we are not preventing updates from rolling out to our users.

### Secrets

In the course of your work, you may require access to project secrets such as API tokens or deployment instances. Any project secrets are shared on a very strict need-to-know basis, and the disclosure of secrets to unauthorised parties may result in removal of your permissions and/or legal action. We trust you, but are obligated to keep our projects secure as well.

### Deployment Access

Most of our projects are hosted under DigitialOcean servers or GitHub Pages.

If, for some reason, you should need access to one of these, ensure you have a public SSH key (SSH-rsa is a good method) to provide to us.

With that, we can discuss allowing you access to the deployment based on the need.

## GitHub

GitHub involves triaging issues and reviewing pull requests, as well as fostering communication between our contributors and enforcing our community guidelines.

### Triaging Issues

By default, when an issue is opened `naomi-lgbt` is assigned and the issue gets a `üö¶ status: awaiting triage` label automatically. This label is used to indicate issues that have not yet received attention from our maintainers.

The first step is to respond to the issue with a comment thanking the contributor for bringing it to our attention. If additional information is needed, ask the necessary questions to help identify the potential resolution for the issue.

Once a resolution has been reached, the issue will need to be re-labelled. Remove `naomi-lgbt`'s assignment and the `üö¶ status: awaiting triage` label. Then, apply the appropriate labels from the list. Each label has a description to help identify its purpose.

Be sure to include at least one label from the `aspect`, `goal`, `priority`, and `status` categories. Typically, the `status` label should be `üèÅ status: ready for dev`.

If you aren't sure what labels to apply, use the `üè∑ status: label work required` and leave everything else unlabelled, and another member will come by to label it.

### Reviewing Pull Requests

Reviewing a pull request does require some understanding of the code base for that particular project. However, we are a community of learning, so if you would like some assistance reviewing a PR let another member know! Someone will help you understand the changes.

The first step is to review the changes made to the code or files using GitHub's UI. You should make sure the changes are logical, add value, and do not add any spam or malicious content.

Then, using whichever method you prefer, pull the changes down locally (or use an environment like GitPod) and test the changes. Make sure the changes resolve the linked issue or implement the feature/fix as expected.

If you are happy with the changes made in the PR, add your review comments and select "Approve". If you would like to see changes, use the GitHub Suggestion feature where possible to create committable changes for the contributor to apply. When not possible, be as clear and descriptive as possible to make the process smoother for the contributor.

If you have any questions about this process, ask your fellow moderators.

### Write Access

All mentees have triage access. If you feel you need direct push access to a repository, reach out to Naomi.

## User Support

Sometimes users may come into our chat looking for help with one of our projects.

As a member of our team, you are essential in providing the smoothest user experience to our members. You should be able to answer questions regarding most of our projects, with Becca being the highest priority. If you don't have an answer for someone's question, you have access to `#council-chat` where you can discuss the question with your fellow staff members and work together to reach a solution.
