# Support Staff

As a member of our support team, you are essential in providing the smoothest user experience to our members. You should be able to answer questions regarding most of our projects, with Becca being the highest priority. If you don't have an answer for someone's question, you have access to #staff-lounge where you can discuss the question with your fellow staff members and work together to reach a solution.

## Premium Support

Members who sponsor us at Gold level or above have access to a premium-support channel,where we offer faster response times to their questions and less noise than a public channel. **Our goal is to maintain response times of less than 1 hour**, so please take extra care with this channel. These members help give us the resources to make our projects happen, so we want to ensure they are receiving the full reward for their support.

## Tickets System

Our chat room has a private tickets system that allows users to create a ticket with the support team. When a user creates a ticket, it's best to allow one support member to work with the user. This way we don't create confusion by having multiple staff interact with the user.

If you intend to handle a ticket, click the "Claim" button in the bot's message and then introduce yourself to the user so they know who will be helping them.

> [!ATTENTION]
> Conversations within a ticket are considered confidential and should NOT be discussed with anyone outside of the staff team.

## Inactive Tickets

If a ticket has been inactive for more than 48 hours, you may close it.
