# Join Our Staff Team

> [!NOTE]
> All positions are a volunteer-only basis, unless a separate written arrangement has been made with you. Do not assume that becoming staff will get you paid.

We source team members by hand, based on activity, length of time in the community, and quality of interactions. If you are selected, Naomi will reach out to you with further instructions.

Members of the mentorship programme are treated like staff.
