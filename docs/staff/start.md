# Global Staff Expectations

We rely on our staff members in any position to help keep our community running smoothly.

These are some general requirements for our staff team. Check the links in the sidebar for information specific to your position.

## Activity Requirements

We do not require specific levels of activity from our staff. We understand that you are volunteering your time to help our community, and it is highly appreciated.

That being said, if you anticipate being inactive for more than a week, we do ask that you let us know in the Discord `#staff-chat`` so we are aware that you will not be around to address issues. If you are inactive for more than a month with no communication, we will remove you from the staff team - however, you will always be welcome to return when your schedule allows!
