# Moderator Guidelines

This page is for our current moderators. It is intended to serve as a reference for handling moderation issues within our community.

Being a moderator does not mean that you are above our community, and we ask that you do not behave as such. It simply means that you are trusted with additional tools to help ensure our community is safe.

## General Expectations

Our moderators are meant to be the example of ideal community members. As such, you should be active within our community, adherent to our rules, and welcoming to our members.

However, you are also still a member of the community yourself. Not every interaction needs to be a moderation action. Socialise with your fellow community members and remember that we are here to have fun!

We have many community platforms, some of which you may not be familiar with. That's okay! While you are trusted to maintain all of our platforms, you only need to moderate the ones you're comfortable with. If you have any questions, you can always reach out to your fellow moderators.

## Discord

Moderating Discord primarily involves ensuring our members are interacting with each other in accordance with our rules. If a member is not acting appropriately, you should take action relative to their infraction.

### Warning a Member

For actions that are mostly harmless, such as mild spam, or an insult that isn't discriminatory (i.e. "You're a jerk"), you can issue a warning. Use Becca to give a warning to the member so the action is appropriately logged.

```txt
/mod warn @user this is the reason
```

### Kicking a Member

If a member is arguing with you directly, spamming a channel, or breaking our rules in a non-excessive manner, often times a kick is sufficient to show them that you are serious about enforcing our standards. Use Becca to kick the member so the action is logged.

```txt
/mod kick @user this is the reason
```

### Banning a Member

Careful consideration must happen before banning a member. Discord bans are IP specific and the member will not be able to rejoin until the ban is lifted. When you need to ban someone, use Becca to do so.

```txt
/mod ban @user 7 this is the reason
```

Becca will ask you to confirm that you intend to do this.

## Working With Fellow Mods

On GitHub, our community organisation has a `moderators` team. Within this team, you can create private discussions that only your fellow moderators will see. On Discord, we have a private staff-chat channel for the same purpose.

These are places where you can bring up concerns, ask fellow moderators how they would approach a situation, or request assistance in dealing with an issue. We will gladly help you resolve the problems at hand.

Remember that we are a team. We do not want to disagree with each other publicly. If you have concerns about a moderation action, or about a fellow moderator's actions, discuss them in one of these private areas. If you cannot reach a resolution, reach out to Naomi for guidance.

## Logging Actions

Moderation actions on Discord are automatically logged. However, moderation actions on other platforms should be manually logged to the `#moderation-log` channel in our Discord community.
