## Data Collection

While we do our best to keep documentation up to date, it is entirely possible that an application collects data which are not documented. These terms provide general guidance on how to request or remove your data, or opt out of data collection.

### Data Collected

At any time, you may request a confirmation of the type and nature of data a specific application collects through our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com).

### Right to Request Data

At any time, you may request a complete copy of your data stored by one of our applications. Requests must be done via our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) from the Discord account the data belongs to. This ensures that a user cannot impersonate you and request your data. We may request additional identifying information, depending on the structure of the data collected by the application.

### Right to Removal

At any time, you may request complete removal of your stored data. Requests must be done via our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) from the Discord account the data belongs to. This ensures that a user cannot impersonate you and request your data. We may request additional identifying information, depending on the structure of the data collected by the application.

This will **not** opt you out of future data collection unless specifically requested. We reserve the right to refuse removal requests when the data are necessary for specific functionality of the app, in circumstances where removing your data would compromise the functionality for all users.

### Right to Opt Out

At any time, you may request to opt out of data collection for an application by requesting removal of your data and discontinuing interaction with the application. We may request additional identifying information, depending on the structure of the data collected by the application.

We reserve the right to refuse opt-out requests when the data are necessary for specific functionality of the app, in circumstances where opting-out would compromise the functionality for all users.

### Data Retention

Data are stored for the minimum necessary time to ensure the application is able to function.

### Availability of Data

Data are available to members of the development team, for the express purpose of debugging, improving, and contributing to the application.
