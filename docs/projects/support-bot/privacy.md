# Privacy Policy

The use of this application is subject to this Privacy Policy. By using this application, you agree to the collection and use of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Data Collected

In order to operate, this application collects the following data:

- User Tag: The application stores the user tag of each user who sends a message in a ticket channel.
- Message Content: The application stores the message content of each message sent in a ticket channel.
- Timestamps: The application stores the timestamp of each message sent in a ticket channel.

Data storage occurs in two separate states.

- For **active** tickets, data is stored in the bot's local file system.
- For **closed** tickets, data is stored in a log file in our support server.

## Right to Request Data

Users may request a copy of log files for their opened tickets by request in our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com). Active ticket records cannot be requested (as the data stored is still available in the user's ticket channel).

## Right to Removal

As logs are stored on platform and for the purpose of training our support staff, requests to remove logs will not be accepted.

## Right to Opt Out

Users may opt out of data collection by refraining from opening tickets.

## Data Retention

Active ticket data in the bot's file system is stored only until the ticket is closed. Inactive ticket data stored on Discord is held indefinitely.

## Availability of Data

Data is available to members of the development team, for the express purpose of debugging, improving, and contributing to the application. Inactive ticket data is available to members of the server staff for training and improvement.

## Questions

Questions and concerns regarding this privacy policy may be directed to `privacy@nhcarrigan.com`.
