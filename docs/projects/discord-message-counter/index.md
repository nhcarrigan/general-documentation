# Discord Message Counter

This is a bot that counts messages sent in a server. This has a few use cases, such as:

- Recognising people who are active in your community
- Seeing how many members have made a suggestion in your suggestions channel
- Granting bonus experience with a level bot based on interaction in a games channel
