# Discord Message Counter

This is a bot that counts messages sent in a server. This has a few use cases, such as:

- Recognising people who are active in your community
- Seeing how many members have made a suggestion in your suggestions channel
- Granting bonus experience with a level bot based on interaction in a games channel

## Setup

Invite the bot with [this invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=888294003966103572&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands). Then grant the bot `View Channel` and `Read Message History` permissions for any channels you want the bot to count messages in.

The `/display` command can be used to show a leaderboard of users by message count, and the `/reset` command can clear your server's message counts.
