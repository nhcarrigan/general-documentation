# Battlesnake

Battlesnake is an online game where players are challenged to create their own snake and defeat other snakes in various matches. The catch? To create a snake, you write an API and logic that the Battlesnake engine can make calls to.

Our Battlesnake is a very basic implementation, with low-level collision avoidance.
