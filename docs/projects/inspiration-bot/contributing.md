# Contributing

In addition to our standard contribution guidelines, there are some extra notes for this project.

## Quotes

Contributing quotes is highly appreciated! To add a quote, head to the `/src/config/QuoteList.ts` file. The `QuoteList` is an array of objects which have a `text` and `author` property.

To add a new quote, place it at the end of the array. The `text` property is the quote content - to get multiple lines, use the `\n` character to insert a line break. The `author` property is the name of the person who _said the quote_, not the name of the person who added it.
