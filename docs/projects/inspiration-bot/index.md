# Inspiration Bot

This is a bot which will post a daily inspirational quote into a channel of your choice, at the time of your choice.

## Setup

Set up the bot with the `/setup` command. This is where you tell it which channel to post in, and what time of day to post.

> [!NOTE]
> The times are converted to UTC, so be sure to keep that in mind when you set your time.
