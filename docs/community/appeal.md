# Appealing A Moderator Decision

Our moderators do not take punitive action (such as kicks, bans, etc.) lightly. However, misunderstandings do happen and everyone makes mistakes.

If you feel that you were restricted from our community unfairly, you can reach out to Naomi to discuss the decision.

## Preparing for Your Appeal

Before reaching out to us, be prepared with some information.

- Have you read our rules and code of conduct?
- Do you agree to follow them?
- Why do you think a moderator took action against you?
- Why do you think this action was unfair?
- Why do you want to resume interaction with our community? What value do you feel you would add?

If you are not prepared for your appeal, we will be less likely to approve it.
